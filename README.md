Each folder present focus section (SQL, DataAnalytics, Testing, Algorithm, Ruby, Python)

### Workflow for SQL:
- Database of choice: PostgreSQL and/or SQLite. SQLite has minimal support for RE hence PostgreSQL is recommended.
- Pandas for pre-processing -> using [Alchemy] to [update/create] [tables]
- [SQLTools] (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SQLTools) plugin for sublime, on MacOS install the sublime package [FixMacPath](https://github.com/int3h/SublimeFixMacPath)to address the path issue when connecting to [PostgreSQL] databases
